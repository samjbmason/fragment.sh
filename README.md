# fragment.sh [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/samjbmason/fragment.sh.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/samjbmason/fragment.sh)

A tool that allows you to backup your secrets using your trusted social circle.

## This project is split into two main folders

- [`www`](https://github.com/samjbmason/fragment.sh/tree/master/www) - This contains all the source code for the website fragment.sh.
- [`api`](https://github.com/samjbmason/fragment.sh/tree/master/api) - This folder contains the endpoints for generating fragmnents and revealing secrets to use the features of fragment.sh programmatically.

I encourage people to check out the source code to make sure they are satisfied that this project isn't doing anything malicious, it's all about trust.
